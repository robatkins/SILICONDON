SurpriseParty is a Java based server for malware staging and command and control.

It's able to communicate to multiple "modular" clients who perform various tasks for the SurpriseParty server.

The SurpriseParty server needs to be able to communicate with different types of clients because the environment of our target will not always be the same.
