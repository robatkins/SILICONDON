Silicon Don is a Java based server for malware staging and command and control.

It's multithreaded and able to communicate to multiple "modular" clients who perform various tasks for the SurpriseParty server.

The Silicon Don server needs to be able to communicate with different types of clients because the environment of our target will not always be the same.
